Types of http request:-

#HTTP Methods
GET - GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
POST - POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
PUT - The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. 
      That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.
DELETE -The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

# Doctype Html: It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect., not
case sensitive.

# Meta Data: The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) 
about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify 
character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords)

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

# Viewport:The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.


# initial scale :When the page is first loaded the initial-scale property controls the initial zoom level
 ie 1 Viewport pixel = 1 CSS pixel. User-scalable, maximum-scale and minimum-scale properties 
 control how the user is able to zoom the page in or out.

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF). A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. 
16-bit Unicode Transformation Format is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode

  Implementation of a PDF file in your HTML web-page is very easy.
  <embed src="file_name.pdf" width="800px" height="2100px" />
  <iframe src="file_name.pdf" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;border: none;"></iframe>

  The <map> tag is used to define an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas.
  The required name attribute of the <map> element is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute 
  and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

  Autofocus -> The autofocus attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies 
  that an <input> element should automatically get focus when the page loads.

  output -> The <output> tag is used to represent the result of a calculation 
          (like one performed by a script).

  ismap(server side mapping) -> The ismap attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, 
  it specifies that the image is part of a server-side image map (an image map is an 
  image with clickable areas). When clicking on a server-side image map, the click coordinates are sent to the server as a URL query string.
